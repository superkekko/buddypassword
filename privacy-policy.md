# Privacy Policy - Chrome extension
Last updated: February 21, 2024

## Data Collection
This extension don't collect any data at all. Since no data is collected, it stands to reason, and is, indeed, the case, that none of your data can be sold to third parties.

That being said, there are a few other ways your data is used.

### Chrome Storage API
The extension take advantage of Google Chrome's Storage API to locally store minimal settings information. Google syncs this information across your various computers and Chrome installations. However, my extensions only access this data locally on your machine and they do not transmit it.

### Cookies
The extension setup only one cookie for decripting the password. The cookie is not trasmitted to any external site and is used only to save in you local machine the key to do the decription for the password.
